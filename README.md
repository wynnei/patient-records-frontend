## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - For database
- [Render](https://render.com/docs/free) - For cloud live site

### What I learned

When deploying to cloud live platform you need to change the urls on the client side of the application to enable communication with the backend because the url use for development most of the time is local host which is locally hosted within the machine.
For example
```js
 const res = await axios.get("https://restaurant.../api/...");
```
Instead of 
```js
const res = await axios.get("http>//localhost:5000/api...");
```

### Continued development
I would like to improve my skill on full stack projects ,JWT and DevOps
